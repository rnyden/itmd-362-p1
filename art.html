			<h2>The Start</h2>
		</header>
		<p>
			The people behind the creation of the game were Evan Duda, Reeanna Nyden, Kamen Petkov, and Jonte' Williams. The artist behind the visuals is Reeanna Nyden. 
			They originally made the game as part of an assignment for a video game design class. 
			They chose the graphic adventure as the genre as it was their favorite genre as they enjoy storytelling.
		</p>
		<p>All of the art was hand drawn, scanned, then edited using picsart.</p>

			Welcome to the home page! This is what players will see when they boot up the game (minus the options of start game). 
			Depicted is the school that your character will be attending. The school's sign features the world's language, Drakuzun (also created by Ms. Nyden). 
			The cartoonish colors help to set the zaney tone of the story.

		<p>This banner for AMDOS was not used as it was thought it would not attract players. However, it does feature the title of the game in the Drakuzun Language. Very exciting!</p>
